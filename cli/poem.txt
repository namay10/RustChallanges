o someone who’s never seen it?
He lives to ninety-nine, he wants it, to see it
To walk on its glass surface, to Blow the seven trumpets.
At this joyous moment gigantic blow wings
Write prophecy all over the sky. How can I tell him 
About sea storms, the chocking bLow
These things, right and wrong, that happen between us?
The prophecy he can’t read is the world, tears
That become sea, sea that dries to salt.
